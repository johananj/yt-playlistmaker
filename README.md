A simple YouTube playlist maker written in Python.
- I have not tested the limits. But I think you can make a playlist containing up to 50 videos through this method.
- For now, it addresses two types of links. But there could be more. Will address them eventually.
# Usage
- Add a list of video links to `playlist.txt`.
- Then run `python get_playlist.py`
- This prints out a link.
- Go to this link, and it leads to an untitled playlist.
- One can mess with the link generated for this untitled playlist, and do other things like add to other playlist, download, so on.
